# zora-cpu
TTL CPU using mostly 7400 series logic

The simulation is made in Logisim. Every component is chosen from a custom library of simulated ICs such as the 7400s. Thus the simulated design should be easy to transform into a real design.

This repo is really just me trying to organize stuff for myself. As such, the documenation and structure of this project is just plain terrible. For the brave souls that do endeavor into the project, do not hesitate to contact me if anything is weird and obscure.
